# HangmanPy

In this little project I developed a classic game called hangman in Python.

The game has two version :

1. **Hangman** : `hangman.py` - This version getting the word from local `.txt` The words in the `words.txt` document were taken from a database of 5000 words, which are the most commonly used in English, and the words such as the adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions were eliminated.  

I have Created a List of terminal games you can play in Termux the Terminal Emulator for Android.<br>

It's just for fun so have fun! :)
